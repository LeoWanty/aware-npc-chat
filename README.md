# Chat with aware NPCs 

I love roleplaying and AI Agent may bring a whole new experience to chatting in games.

I want to build an AI Agent system that takes allow NPCs (Non Player Characters) to talk with you 
according to their own knowledge of the world they live in.

## Program
- [ ] **Prerequisites:**
  - [ ] Build a knowledge base (characters, places, events, objects)
  - [x] Build a simple and effective chat interface
  - [ ] Code basic agents to retrieve useful information and converse

- [ ] **Iterate to improve quality:**
  - [ ] Improve the agent system, particularly by grading the level of accessible knowledge
  - [ ] Integrate an emotional dimension into the responses

- [ ] **Bonus, not everything can be done:**
  - [ ] Generate alternative images translating the character's emotions with each response
  - [ ] An interface "behind the scenes of the chat," to visualize the work of the agents in the background
  - [ ] Generalize the process of building the knowledge base
