                    "description": "\nIn the incident that sparked his entrance into politics, Mallow was sent to [[Korell]] to investigate the disappearance of several Foundation ships. He receives an invitation to meet with the Commdor of Korell, [[Asper Argo]] soon after. \nSeveral months later, [[Jorane Sutt]], the Mayor's secretary, accused him of murder for his abandonment of the priest (which, while technically legal, will wreck Mallow's reputation), but during the trial Mallow reveals the priest was actually a Korellian secret police agent: the man was not in any real danger, as he was just bait to see if the Foundation ships would break the law. However, much to everyone's surprise, Mallow has the Navy retreat without presenting battle, and does not do anything beyond stopping trade with Korell. As he explains later to a friend of his, though, there are good reasons behind this policy: \n* While the Foundation's ships and fleet are possibly more powerful than that of Korell's, Korell is in contact with the [[Galactic Empire|Empire]], and should the Foundation defeat Korell by force of arms, the Empire might decide to attack the Foundation before the Foundation can defend itself from the Empire. \n* Korell's economy has been retooled to work pretty much with the Foundation's technology. As household appliances and industrial machine breaks down, Argo begins to lose support, which he cannot recoup with a patriotism surge because war has not come to Korell, and industries cannot re-engineer themselves to work with the old methods because of the great costs involved. * Finally, the Empire cannot supply Korell with machinery as good as the Foundation's due to their loss of scientific knowledge. Eventually, Mallow's analysis proves true and Korell surrenders bloodlessly to the Foundation, allowing them to start a new phase of expansion at the cost of slowly turning the Foundation into a plutocracy ruled by Merchant Princes.",

When she overheard a conspiracy between her father, [[Pelleas Anthor]] and others, to track down the members of the Second Foundation, she decided to stow away in a private spaceship owned by her \"uncle\" [[Homir Munn]], a librarian, to travel to [[Kalgan]]. \n\nAfter some trouble on [[Kalgan]] with [[Lord Stettin]] she managed to escape, with the aid of [[Lady Callia]] and [[Preem Palver]], to Trantor. After the conclusion of the [[Stettinian War]] between the First Foundation and Kalgan in 377 F.E., she returned to Terminus. In later life, Arkady became a famous historical novelist, writing the books ''Unkeyed Memories'' and ''Time and Time and Over'' about [[Kalgan]]ian society of the early [[Interregnum]], although her best-known work remained her biography of her grandmother.",

As the Kalganian ships came within range of the Foundation's fleet, a detachment of 50 ships led by Commander Cenn made a ten-parsec hyperspatial jump away from the Quoriston system. The remaining 75 Foundation ships maneuvered the Kalganian battle fleet into a specific area of space, then attacked. The Kalganian ships were fully engaged with Dixyl's ships when Cenn's detachment came out of hyperspace in the Kalganian rear and joined the attack. Facing an unexpected enemy in their rear, the Kalganian ships broke formation and attempted to retreat. Only sixty of the original 300 Kalganian ships survived to reach Kalgan, while the Foundation Navy's Third Fleet lost only eight ships. Lev Meirus signed for Kalgan.",

                    "description": "The '''Great Sack of Trantor''', also known as the '''Fall of Trantor''', was a major event of the Interregnum, in which [[Trantor]] was devastated. \n\nThe early [[First Speaker|First Speakers]] of the Second Foundation also worked out a clear vision of the Sack with more developed psychohistory (although they already had at least an outline from Hari), decades before it occured but had found no solution, no way of assuring both the salvation of Trantor and the eventual establishment of the [[Second Galactic Empire|Second Empire]]. The lesser evil had to be chosen, and they chose to allow Trantor to die. \n\nImperial power quickly collapsed, and Gilmer and his soldiers occupied the Imperial palace as [[Galactic Emperors|Galactic Emperor]] [[Dagobert VIII]], his son [[Dagobert IX]], and the remaining citizens of the Empire, who were evacuated by the dedicated Grey bureaucracy, were forced to flee to the nearby world of Delicass, which they chose to rename [[Neotrantor]], in the Seven Days Flight. \n\nIn one phase of the event, the space elevators of [[Trantor]] broke apart. The upper half of each great tether, including the transfer stations, spun away into space, while the lower half, weighing billions of tons, plummeted into the ground at incredible speeds, releasing enough explosive force to pierce the metal veneer all the way to Trantor's geothermal power pipes, unleashing a global chain of new volcanoes. In any case, of all of Trantor the Library/University complex endured through the period of devastation.  \n\nAfter the Sack, Gilmer ruled Trantor for a short time. Most of the buildings on the planet were destroyed during the Sack, and over the course of the next two centuries the metal on Trantor was gradually sold off, as farmers uncovered more and more soil to use in their farms. Eventually the farmers grew to become the sole recognized inhabitants of the planet, and the era of Trantor as the central world of the galaxy came to a close. \nThe news that Trantor had been sacked slowly spread across the Galaxy, and all were shocked and afraid, especially on the world of Rossem, whose people feared that the end of the Galaxy itself was at hand. \n==Behind the Scenes==\nThe Sack of [[Trantor]] may have been inspired by the Sack of Rome in 546 AD which was carried out by the Gothic king Totila during the Gothic War of 535\u2013554 AD between the Ostrogoths and the Byzantine Empire. \n\n[[Category:Foundation Universe]]\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:Trantor]]",

She became a legend throughout the [[Spacer]] worlds but was forgotten on Earth. \n==== Finding Nestor ====\nIn 2029, she left Earth for the first time to visit Hyper Base, a military research station on an asteroid, and to find the NS-2 (Nestor) robot in a room with 62 other physically identical robots, after it's owner, Gerald Black, lost his temper, swearing at it and telling the robot to get lost, working with Mathematical Director Peter Bogert. After several failures together costing half a billion dollars, JN-5 (also known as Jane) was produced and the company planned to use it (her) to analyse astronomical data at the Lowell Observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona, to calculate the most likely stars in the vicinity of Earth to have habitable planets. \n\n\n\n\n\n<br />\n[[Category:Foundation Universe]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Earther]]",
